# Plastic Pollution Tracker

PPT displays levels of bottle pollution in Earth's major oceans. These levels are on a scale of 1-3 and are relative to the maximum total of instances found in one ocean. Data is received from ArcGIS api. 

## Preface
This project was a quick write up during my last semester in 2021 for fun. The code works great but the presentation can be improved and algorithm can be a lot more efficient so the goal is to fix up the glaring issues.

## Issues
* The site is not responsive due to the image map
* When creating tables with a lot of values there's a delay
* Javascript code readability
* Duplicate calls for library
* Remakes a table every click
* I do not like the table ;)

## Mission
My mission is to fix these issues and upload a new version for comparison.

When completed it will be found in the **version 1.0** folder.

In the **version 0.1** folder is the original site.

## Installation

1. Click [here](https://github.com/Ross-Can/Plastic-Pollution-Tracker/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to install the current version of the stamina challenge.
2. Uncompress the zip file
3. Double click/open the **v 0.1** folder to open access the original site.
4. Double click/open the **home_page.html** file to open my program in your default browser.

## Usage
* Click an ocean on the map.
* An image is placed with one of the three levels where clicked
* Coordinates, Ocean, and Instance Count is displayed on the table

1. LEVEL 1 : around the minimum amount of pollution comparatively 
2. LEVEL 2 : around the midpoint amount of pollution comparatively 
3. LEVEL 3 : around the maximum amount of pollution comparatively
